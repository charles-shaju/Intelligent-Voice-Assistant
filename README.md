# Intelligent-Voice-Assistant
A intelligent voice assistant that uses tensorflow to identify the commands that the user provide.. Any type of command can be done using this Assistant, and any type reply can be providesas by the user's interest.We can easily say it as a extension of [NeuralNine](https://github.com/NeuralNine/neuralintents.git "Neuralintent github page") But I have made some modification to make it work more efficiently

## To make this code work:
1. You should have python and tensorflow installed in your system
2. Paste the neuralintent folder to your `AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages` on your system.

This is completely a python file, so you can run this in the terminal by: python main.py
